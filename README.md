# TCP Client-Server Threading

Simple example on how to implement a non-blocking TCP communication Python program via multi-treading.

Source code [a_threading.py](https://github.com/hafiz-kamilin/exercise_tcpClientServerThreading/blob/master/code/a_threading.py) and source code [b_threading.py](https://github.com/hafiz-kamilin/exercise_tcpClientServerThreading/blob/master/code/b_threading.py) both represent the client and server at the same time and it can be run on the same computer due to both programs connecting to the same home address (127.0.0.1).
